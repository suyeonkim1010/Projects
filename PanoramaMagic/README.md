# CMPUT 206 Assignment 3 - Image Processing Showcase

This project is a rebranding of classic image processing tasks, divided into four core parts, showcasing different transformation and visualization techniques in Python using `skimage`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

## 📁 Output Preview
Below are the saved result images, generated automatically by the script:

| Task                              | Output File Name                         |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Bayer pattern interpolation       | `Bayer_reconstruction.png`               |
| Floyd-Steinberg dithering         | `Dithered_mandrill.png`                  |
| Geometric Transformations         | `Original Image.png`, `Rotated+Scaled+Skewed Image.png`, `Combined Warp w Bilinear Interpolation Image.png` |
| Panorama stitching (ORB + RANSAC) | `Warped 1st & 2nd.png`, `Merged image.png`, `imgOut.png`, `10 random inlier matches.png` |

## 🧩 Part 1 - Bayer Pattern Interpolation
**Goal:** Reconstruct an RGB image from a Bayer-filtered grayscale input.

🔹 Channels (Red, Green, Blue) are interpolated using neighborhood values based on the Bayer pattern.

📸 **Saved Outputs:**
- Green Channel, Red Channel, Blue Channel, and the final RGB composite in `Bayer_reconstruction.png`

---

## 🎨 Part 2 - Dithering with a KMeans Palette
**Goal:** Reduce color complexity using a palette generated by KMeans clustering.

🔹 Modified Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied to minimize color quantization errors visually.

📸 **Saved Output:**
- `Dithered_mandrill.png`

---

## 🔄 Part 3 - Geometric Transformations
**Goal:** Apply rotation, scaling, and skew transformations and visualize the combination.

🔹 Matrix multiplications are composed manually for each transformation.

📸 **Saved Outputs:**
- Original image: `Original Image.png`
- Combined transformation: `Rotated+Scaled+Skewed Image.png`
- Bilinear interpolation result: `Combined Warp w Bilinear Interpolation Image.png`

---

## 🧵 Part 4 - Panorama Stitching
**Goal:** Align and merge two overlapping images using local features.

🔹 Feature extraction (ORB), descriptor matching, RANSAC-based homography, and warping are employed.

📸 **Saved Outputs:**
- Warped individual images: `Warped 1st & 2nd.png`
- Final merged panorama: `Merged image.png`, `imgOut.png`
- Inlier match visualization: `10 random inlier matches.png`

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Ensure all required libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image scipy scikit-learn
```
Run the script with:
```bash
python PanoramaMagic.py
```

All result images will be saved in the current working directory.

## 📌 Notes
- Results may slightly vary depending on randomness (e.g., KMeans, RANSAC).
- Best viewed with consistent image dimensions and normalized formats.
